vcryptor is a simple program that allows you to encrypt or decrypt a file based
on a simple polyalphabetic key-word based cypher that has been extended to
include all 256 ascii characters.

For usage instructions compile the program and run it with "- h" as an input.
The instructions are quite stright forward.

Beware: This program will edit the binary data of a file.  If the passwords for
encryption and decryption and the correct sequence is forgotton, the files will
be garbage.  Back up your files.

Note: you can also decrypt unencrypted files to effectively encrypt them.

Feel free to use this code!  Please just reference me in the code that uses this
as "Bryan A. Clifford".  Email me with any questions/comments/constructive
feedback at "blackscout111@gmail.com".
